# Genshin Impact Talent Check Web 

This is the *web* version of Genshin Impact Talent Check.

If you want a lighter version of this program that runs on **command line**, [click here](https://github.com/GMarqz/writeFile).

This web version is a ***work in progress*** and the author is still working on *frontend*.

When completed, users shall be able to:

- **Select** the characters they're building atm
- **Check** how much materials they'll need for the talent specific level 
- **Set a *goal* and a *description*** for each character
- **Set a level of priority** for each building characters
- **Mark** a specific character to `ðŸ›‘Break` if they give up on building the character

## Next steps

- Add a feature that returns how many materials is needed to increase a talent level to the next level or any selected level.
- Change modal style
